# modebloat
A modular Android debloating tool

# How do I use it?
Create a directory called `bloatlists` in the root folder, put your bloat lists inside (.txt extension), and `python3 modebloat.py`! The bloatlist folder is searched recursively so subfolders are allowed. The list of disabled packages will be in a file called `disabled.txt` for future reference and easy reversibility.
